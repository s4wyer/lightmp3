OrganLMP skin by Daucus

Description
------------------------------------------------------
This skin was inspired by the Organ v2.0 5.00m33 ctf and flahs0 theme. Where I wanted my music player also to match the main theme of my psp. Inside the extract is two folders one is the font folder and the other is the lightmp3 folder. You will need both of these folders in order to make the theme work. The purpose of the font folder is change the font of the skin, due to the organ's main font threw things of when applied to the skin.




INSTALLATION

1. extract the font folder into the root of your psp's memory stick.

2. extract the LightMP3 folder into the same folder as your lightMP3 app is saved to. (Should be ms0:/PSP/GAME)
